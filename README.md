# quera-django-bootcamp

I'm trying to document all the codes and commands or any other useful peace of data from quera software engineering with django boot camp in this repository.

feel free to add any thing that I missed out.

# structure of document

this boot camp is 12 week long and every week has 2 days of online lectures and every laecture day contains 3 lectures.
so I will use directories to organize the materials and a simple markdown file for documentations.

this is my first time documenting something like this if there is anybody with other ideas of how to structure this documents or perhaps use another technology I would love to hear them out.

# contribution 

if there are any technical or other problems in this documentation just raise an issue or send a pull request I will check them almost every night.
